# p3 project

This is the third project(p3) for the dwa15 class. This project is a single-page web application built using the LAMP stack.

The main goal of this project is to generate a random password based on user inputs. The users can specify:

* number of words in password
* words separator
* words complexities like whether it needs (and they appended to the password string)
  - numbers or
  - other special characters in the password.
* case for the password ( upperCase, lowerCase and camelCase supported currently.)

Upon Submission of the form it generates and displays the password.

It is built per the instructions of the demo ( http://dwa15.com/Projects.../P3).
